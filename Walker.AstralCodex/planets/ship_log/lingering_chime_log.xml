My species and my world are gone. But I have reached the Eye and that gives me hope that my people may be remembered. The Chime is ready. The light from the death of the final star has reached my receptors and I am prepared for the final journey of this universe. 
You now hold the Astral Codex, the sum of all knowledge my species has recorded and preserved throughout our lifetime.
But your own time of ending is close at hand. Before you retire to oblivion, I humbly request: add your knowledge to the Codex and pass it onward. Send whatever device you possess on a final journey through the Eye, that the Codex may persist, and grow, and inform the worthy species in the next cycle of what came before.
Remember us.<![CDATA[</Color>]]></Text>

The Nomai are true scholars, always curious about the nature of our universe. Their advanced technology is spread throughout the galaxy and one clan's generations-long search for the Eye has had a profound role in the final days of this universe.

The Strangers were archivists, preserving information at any cost. But their fear of the Eye led them to hide from the world inside a simulation of their own creation. Until a single individual released the signal for the Nomai to find, and was imprisoned for their actions.
