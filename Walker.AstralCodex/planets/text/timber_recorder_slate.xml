			<Page>Hornfels insisted I bring this recorder with me to "document any unknown Nomai artifacts". If you ask me, I think they're being a little too optimistic. I'm not going to find anything of interest on such a routine expedition.</Page>
			<Page>Oh well. Here we go anyways. Slate's Expedition Log: Day 1</Page>
			<Page>I'm out here by the ol' Nomai ruins to see if I can scrounge up an intact warp core or two for the hatchling. Gotta get their scout properly equipped before they set out for the stars.</Page>
			<Page>I found some pretty quickly by that weird spiral ruin. Four of them were even still intact. Jackpot!</Page>
			<Page>I maaaay have gotten a bit too late of a start though and the sun's already setting so I might as well make camp here before heading back. Good thing I brought plenty of marshmallows, eh?</Page>
			<Page><![CDATA[<size=60>]]>Ahhhhhhhhh!<![CDATA[</size>]]> What's going on?! Wait no, get back here! Take that!</Page>
			<Page>Ok. <![CDATA[<Pause=0.5>]]>Calm down. <![CDATA[<Pause=0.5>]]>What the heck? What was that thing?</Page> 
			<Page>I woke up to this faint ringing noise, almost to quiet to hear. When I opened my eyes, my campfire was moving. It just... lifted into the air like something had grabbed it. Then it floated off into the sky like some kind of ghost.</Page>
			<Page>I whacked at it with my marshmallow stick and it sounded like I hit something. But it just kept going. It even took the warp cores I found too!</Page>
			<Page>That can't have been real, right? I must have had too much sap wine recently. I'm going back to the village and never camping here again. Hornfels can make one of the other venturers go find a core.</Page>
