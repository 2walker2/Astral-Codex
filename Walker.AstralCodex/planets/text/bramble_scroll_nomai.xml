		<Text>OENO: I am pleased to report that our research is progressing rapidly! We have determined that the space within <![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>Dark Bramble<![CDATA[</Color>]]> is distorted to an impossible degree. This space cannot possibly exist within a single location.</Text>

		<Text>CYCAD: Hypothesis: when an object, or entity, enters <![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>Dark Bramble<![CDATA[</Color>]]>, the interior manifests elsewhere within a pocket of space linked to this one. This manifestation would exert a repelling force on objects in its surroundings even when unoccupied.</Text>

		<Text>OENO: By studying the sky after an object has entered <![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>Dark Bramble<![CDATA[</Color>]]>, we believe we have located the space the interior occupies. Coleus informs us that the phenomenon is most unsettling to observe.</Text>
