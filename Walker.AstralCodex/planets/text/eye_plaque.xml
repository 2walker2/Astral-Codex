			<Page>A little scout just like this one is now home to the Astral Codec: a means of transmitting information via the Eye, passed to us from the universe before ours.</Page>
			<Page>Although the Codec's authors are long gone, they have given us the opportunity to save the story of this universe from being lost to the depths of time.</Page>
			<Page>If it is released into the Eye, the Astral Codec will pass onwards into the next universe, preserving a thread of memory for eons to come.</Page>
