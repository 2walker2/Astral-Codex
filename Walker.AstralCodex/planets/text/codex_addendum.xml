Addendum by: The Hatchling
The Strangers were archivists, preserving information at any cost. But their fear of the Eye led them to hide from the world inside a simulation of their own creation. Until a single individual released the signal for the Nomai to find, and was imprisoned for their actions.

The Nomai are true scholars, always curious about the nature of our universe. Their advanced technology is spread throughout the galaxy and one clan's generations-long search for the Eye has had a profound role in the final days of this universe.

I am a Hearthian. A young species but the bravest I know. We play music and roast marshmallows with friends around a campfire. And we do not fear death! (except maybe Riebeck)</Page>
