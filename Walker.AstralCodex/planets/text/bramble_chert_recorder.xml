			<Page>Chert’s Research Notes — property of Chert!</Page>
			<Page>This is the only known Nomai construction on <![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>Dark Bramble<![CDATA[</Color>]]>. Interestingly, its material places it as one of the newest Nomai structures I've explored.</Page>
			<Page>It looks like construction was never finished. Was it abandoned? Or did something happen to the Nomai here?</Page>
			<Page>The probe down on the observation deck is clearly used for research of some sort. But what were they studying?</Page>
			<Page>There's a device mounted to the probe. I know I've seen devices like it in other Nomai ruins but this one seems to be deactivated.</Page>
			<Page>Oh hey, I just spotted a supernova while taking down camp. Those are normally pretty rare. Neat!</Page>
