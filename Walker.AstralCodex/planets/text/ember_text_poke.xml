		<Text>POKE: I depart soon to explore the <![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>comet<![CDATA[</Color>]]> alongside Pye and Clary. However, when I return, I will investigate any way to reduce the energy the warp core requires (perhaps with more precision...).</Text>

Once we have found the <![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>Eye<![CDATA[</Color>]]>, imagine what else we could achieve with this technology! With a negative time interval on this scale, we could potentially duplicate matter (or even one of us).</Text>
