		<Text>POKE: We have failed, Annona. Though the fault does not lie with the warp core I crafted, I cannot help but feel some responsibility. Hypothesis: had I better understood your designs, less energy would have been required.</Text>

		<Text>POKE: However, despite this doubt (and the struggle of living without you), I will press on. Like this tree before me, we Nomai can thrive even in an environment far from our home.</Text>

		<Text>POKE: I depart soon to explore the <![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>comet<![CDATA[</Color>]]> alongside Pye and Clary. However, when I return, I will investigate any way to reduce the energy the warp core requires (perhaps with more precision...).</Text>

		<Text>POKE: The possibilities of the <![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>Ash Twin Project<![CDATA[</Color>]]> still excite me. Once we have found the <![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>Eye<![CDATA[</Color>]]>, imagine what else we could achieve with this technology! With a negative time interval on this scale, we could potentially duplicate matter (or even one of us).</Text>

		<Text>POKE: I spoke of this to Root outside the <![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>Ash Twin Project<![CDATA[</Color>]]> when we installed its warp core. Imagine - temporal clones could be used to temporarily increase the population of our clan. How would it feel to work alongside a future version of yourself?</Text>

		<Text>CLARY: Hypothesis: two of you would be too much for the fabric of spacetime (or me) to handle. Come, sister, the shuttle is almost ready.</Text>
