		<Text>ARCHIVIST: Signal transmitter online. This place will not be easily lost.</Text>

		<ID>2</ID>
		<Text>SCIENTIST: Then our journey is at an end. We've sent our spark upon the unknowable sea. All that remains is to wait - and to hope.</Text>

		<ID>3</ID>
		<Text>SCIENTIST: Our universe is cold but the experiences it contained will breath life into the next. May the Codec soon hurtle into a newborn universe, preserving the past and recording the future.</Text>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>4</ID>
		<Text>EXPLORER: I hope the next universe is different. More curious y'know. More willing to seek out knowledge amongst the stars, like we did.</Text>

		<Text>ARCHIVIST: I hope they preserve our story. I fear that they will not - that we are but a dwindling specter of a forgotten people.</Text>

		<Text>EXPLORER: I hope they cherish it. Maybe they'll tell it to each other around a campfire someday and it will remind them that the astral sea is not as lonely as it appears.</Text>

		<Text>EXPLORER: One day, someone else will stand here in this place. They too will face the end of all they know. I hope they find this echo. I hope they take comfort in knowing that we came before, that they are not alone.</Text>
	</TextBlock>
	<TextBlock>
		<ID>9</ID>
		<Text>SCIENTIST: The time has come, friends. Shall we collapse the enumerable possibilities laid before us? A final coda to a dead universe.</Text>

	<TextBlock>
		<ID>10</ID>
		<Text>EXPLORER: But more importantly, a prelude to what comes next.</Text>
